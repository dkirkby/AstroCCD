# Jupyter Notebooks Related to Astronomical CCD Sensors

There are currently two notebooks here:
* Poisson: a pedagogical introduction to the electrostatics within a
CCD that leads to the buried channel where charge is stored.
* Fringing: a study of the mechanisms and phenomenology of fringing
in astronomical CCDs.
* LabData: utilities and results from looking a lab sensor data.
